# Jumpstart

The projects in this repository are staring projects, their purpose is to accelerate the starting process when creating a new project. You can just copy the the folders, install the dependencies and start your project from there.

## Installation

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/caganseyrek/Jumpstart.git
```

Then navigate to folder of the cloned repository and use the codes/projects you need:

```bash
cd path/to/Jumpstart
```

> **Note:** Projects do **not** have their own `.git/` folder inside them. Don't forget to initialize a new repository for the projects you use.
